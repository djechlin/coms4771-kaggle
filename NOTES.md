1. Clean the strings up.
2. For a given model there are two questions: how many columns can I get away with and be performant? And, how many rows can I get away with and be performant? Want to try exponentially increasing them at count = 1,2,4,8,16,...
3. Everything needs to be in github. This includes code used to clean the data, etc.
4. My cleaned file needs to be backed up. Go ahead and make it private. 
5. You can order the dimensions by how well they work as decision stumps. Note decision stumps are fairly cheap to explode over a multiclass.
6. Print start time / end time or durations for everything.
